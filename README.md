# EvoXT VPS Hosting: Lightning-Fast Performance, Global Coverage, Budget-Friendly Pricing

Look, I'm not going to feed you the usual hosting fairy tale where everything is perfect and every server floats on clouds made of dreams. The reality is, most VPS providers either burn a hole in your wallet or hand you servers that move slower than rush-hour traffic. But here's the thing—EvoXT somehow manages to dodge both of these problems, and that's worth talking about.

You're probably here because you've been hunting for a VPS that doesn't feel like you're mortgaging your future just to host a website or run some development projects. Maybe you've tried the big names and realized their "affordable" plans come with hidden fees that pop up like unwanted party guests. Or perhaps you've tested budget providers and watched your applications crawl along like they're stuck in molasses.

EvoXT sits in this interesting middle ground. They're offering virtual machines with CPU frequencies that actually reach up to 6.0 GHz—and no, that's not a typo—while keeping prices starting at just $2.99 per month. The Malaysian company has quietly expanded to 16 data center locations worldwide, and users on Reddit are sharing stories about performance that genuinely surprised them.

So let's dig into what makes EvoXT worth your attention, and more importantly, whether it fits what you're actually looking for.

**What EvoXT Actually Offers**

EvoXT built their business around one core promise: high CPU frequency virtual machines at prices that don't require a finance degree to justify. They're using AMD EPYC Genoa processors, specifically the 9004 series, which pack serious punch for single-core performance.

Here's what caught my attention when looking through their setup. Most providers slap you with a 2.3 GHz or 2.4 GHz processor and call it a day. EvoXT? They're running CPUs that turbo boost up to 6.0 GHz. That's not just marketing fluff—it translates to real-world speed differences when you're running applications that depend on single-threaded performance.

The company operates from Malaysia but has spread its infrastructure across 16 regions. We're talking United States (multiple locations), United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Poland, Amsterdam, France, Switzerland, Japan (both Tokyo and Osaka), Malaysia (regular and premium tiers), Indonesia, Australia, Hong Kong, and South Korea. That's a lot of options when you need your server close to your users.

Every plan includes weekly automatic offsite backups at no extra cost. That's the kind of feature that usually gets locked behind "enterprise" tiers elsewhere, but EvoXT throws it in as standard. They're also supporting both Linux and Windows Server deployments with one-click installs for popular applications.

**Breaking Down The Pricing Structure**

Let me show you what you're actually paying for with EvoXT's standard tier (covering most global locations like US, UK, Canada, Germany, and others):

| Plan | CPU Cores | RAM | NVMe Storage | Monthly Bandwidth | Weekly Backup | Monthly Price |  Get Started |
|------|-----------|-----|--------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| VM-0.5 | 1 core (Up to 6.0 GHz) | 512 MB | 5 GB | 500 GB | ✓ | $2.99 |  [Order VM-0.5](https://console.evoxt.com/aff.php?aff=1168) |
| VM-0.75 | 1 core (Up to 6.0 GHz) | 1 GB | 10 GB | 750 GB | ✓ | $4.99 |  [Order VM-0.75](https://console.evoxt.com/aff.php?aff=1168) |
| VM-1 | 1 core (Up to 6.0 GHz) | 2 GB | 20 GB | 1000 GB | ✓ | $5.99 |  [Order VM-1](https://console.evoxt.com/aff.php?aff=1168) |
| VM-1.5 | 2 cores (Up to 6.0 GHz) | 2 GB | 20 GB | 1500 GB | ✓ | $6.95 |  [Order VM-1.5](https://console.evoxt.com/aff.php?aff=1168) |
| VM-2 | 2 cores (Up to 6.0 GHz) | 4 GB | 30 GB | 2000 GB | ✓ | $11.99 |  [Order VM-2](https://console.evoxt.com/aff.php?aff=1168) |
| VM-3 | 4 cores (Up to 6.0 GHz) | 4 GB | 30 GB | 3000 GB | ✓ | $14.99 |  [Order VM-3](https://console.evoxt.com/aff.php?aff=1168) |
| VM-4 | 4 cores (Up to 6.0 GHz) | 8 GB | 60 GB | 4000 GB | ✓ | $23.99 |  [Order VM-4](https://console.evoxt.com/aff.php?aff=1168) |
| VM-6 | 8 cores (Up to 6.0 GHz) | 8 GB | 60 GB | 5000 GB | ✓ | $29.99 |  [Order VM-6](https://console.evoxt.com/aff.php?aff=1168) |
| VM-8 | 8 cores (Up to 6.0 GHz) | 16 GB | 80 GB | 6000 GB | ✓ | $47.99 |  [Order VM-8](https://console.evoxt.com/aff.php?aff=1168) |
| VM-12 | 16 cores (Up to 6.0 GHz) | 16 GB | 80 GB | 8000 GB | ✓ | $60.95 |  [Order VM-12](https://console.evoxt.com/aff.php?aff=1168) |
| VM-16 | 16 cores (Up to 6.0 GHz) | 32 GB | 100 GB | 10 TB | ✓ | $95.99 |  [Order VM-16](https://console.evoxt.com/aff.php?aff=1168) |

All these plans run on gigabit ports, which means your network connection isn't artificially throttled like some providers do with their entry-level plans.

For their premium network locations (Hong Kong, Japan Osaka, and Malaysia Premium), the pricing stays identical but bandwidth allocations are more conservative due to higher infrastructure costs in those regions. For example, the VM-1 plan gets 500 GB instead of 1000 GB monthly transfer in premium locations.

**Current Promo Codes For January 2026**

Here's something actually useful—EvoXT runs recurring discount promotions that apply month after month, not just the first billing cycle. Based on current verified sources, you can snag a 40% recurring discount for Cloud Virtual Machines on VM-1 plans and above. There's also a 5% discount code floating around for all Virtual Machines and Dedicated Servers.

These aren't the typical "first month only" tricks you see elsewhere. The 40% recurring discount actually sticks around, which changes the math considerably when you're budgeting for long-term hosting.

**What Users Are Actually Saying**

I dug through Reddit threads and review sites to see what real users think beyond the marketing materials. One Reddit user posted about their experience with EvoXT's South Korea VPS after testing several providers. They mentioned the Seoul location uses KT (Korea Telecom) backbone with direct routes to China for all three major ISPs. Their benchmark testing showed NVMe I/O speeds hitting 1900 MB/s, which they described as "insane for this price range."

The same user deployed WordPress installs and Python scripts without issues, praising the control panel's ease of use and the support for Alipay payments (particularly useful for users in Asia).

Over on VPSBenchmarks, EvoXT gets compared against bigger names like Vultr, DigitalOcean, and Contabo. The performance metrics show competitive single-core scores, which makes sense given those AMD EPYC Genoa chips with their high clock speeds.

Trustpilot has limited reviews (five at last check), but the company maintains communication through their official channels and seems responsive to technical issues based on community forums like LowEndTalk.

**The AMD EPYC Genoa Advantage**

Let's talk about the hardware for a second, because it matters. EvoXT uses AMD's 4th generation EPYC processors, specifically the 9004 series codenamed Genoa. These chips are built on Zen 4 architecture using 5nm process technology.

What does that mean in non-technical terms? Better single-threaded performance, lower power consumption, and more cores packed into each processor. The Genoa lineup supports up to 96 cores with 192 threads, though EvoXT allocates cores based on your plan tier. Each core can turbo boost up to 6.0 GHz under the right conditions.

The storage uses pure NVMe SSDs, not the hybrid SATA/NVMe setup some budget providers use. NVMe delivers significantly faster read/write speeds, which you'll notice when databases query data or applications load assets.

**Management Features That Actually Help**

EvoXT built their control panel with practical features instead of just checking boxes. You get browser-based VNC access, so you can control your virtual machine even if SSH or RDP connections fail. The firewall management happens at layer 3 before traffic even reaches your VM, giving you better DDoS protection without installing extra software.

IP address management lets you swap and reassign IPs between servers, which comes in handy for failover setups or migrating production environments without downtime. They support ordering additional floating IP addresses as your infrastructure grows.

The cloning feature saves time when you need to replicate server configurations. Instead of manually reinstalling and reconfiguring everything, you clone an existing VM and adjust as needed.

Sub-accounts allow you to give access to different team members with appropriate permission levels. Your billing team doesn't need root access, and your technical staff doesn't need billing permissions.

All VMs include API access, so you can automate deployments, configurations, and monitoring through scripts without logging into the web interface.

**Scaling Options When You Need Them**

If you start with a smaller plan and outgrow it, EvoXT lets you scale resources without migrating to a completely new server. Here's what upgrades cost:

- Extra CPU core: $3 per month per core
- Extra RAM: $2 per month per GB  
- Monthly bandwidth: $3 per month per TB (standard network) or $12 per month per TB (premium network)
- Additional IP address: $3 per month
- Paid backup plans: Pricing depends on your VM storage size

You manage these upgrades directly from your VM control panel, and they apply without wiping your existing configuration.

**The Global Infrastructure Reality**

Having 16 data center locations sounds impressive, but what actually matters is whether they have a server near your target audience. EvoXT's spread covers the major markets reasonably well.

North America gets covered with locations in multiple US cities, Canada (Montreal specifically), making it viable for targeting both US and Canadian audiences. Europe has solid coverage with Amsterdam (connected to multiple internet exchanges including AMS-IX), Germany (DE-CIX connected), London (LINX), France (France-IX), Poland, and Switzerland (SwissIX with strong privacy laws).

Asia-Pacific is where EvoXT really invested, probably due to their Malaysian base. They operate in Malaysia (both standard and premium tiers), Indonesia (Jakarta with JKT-IX), Japan (Tokyo and Osaka with BBIX and JPIX), Hong Kong (CN2 network with optimized China routing), South Korea (KINX with Korea Telecom), and Australia (connected to major local exchanges).

Each location connects to tier-1 ISPs and regional internet exchanges, which affects latency and routing quality to end users. The specific peering relationships matter more than just having a server in a region—EvoXT seems aware of this based on their technical specifications.

**Security Layers That Make Sense**

EvoXT implements several security measures that go beyond the basics. Virtual machines run in isolated environments using KVM hypervisors, which provides better security than container-based virtualization. Your VM resources aren't shared directly with other users' VMs at the operating system level.

The layer 3 firewall lets you set rules without even connecting to your virtual machine. You define allowed ports, protocols, and IP ranges through the control panel, and the firewall enforces these rules before traffic reaches your server. This provides protection against volumetric DDoS attacks at the network edge.

Automatic weekly offsite backups store copies of your data in separate infrastructure. If something catastrophic happens to the primary data center, your backups exist elsewhere and can be restored. The frequency (weekly) works for most use cases, though mission-critical applications might want to supplement with more frequent backup solutions.

They accept cryptocurrency payments (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and USDt Tron), which adds a privacy layer for users who prefer not linking traditional payment methods to hosting services.

**The Support And Uptime Question**

EvoXT guarantees 99.99% uptime, which translates to roughly 4.38 minutes of acceptable downtime per month or about 52.6 minutes per year. That's standard for the industry, though the guarantee matters less than actual performance. Community feedback suggests they generally hit this target, though like any provider, occasional issues pop up.

Support channels include ticket system access through the client portal. Response times vary based on issue urgency and time zones, which is standard for a globally distributed company. The documentation covers common setup scenarios and troubleshooting steps.

One useful aspect—deployment speed averages around 2.5 minutes from order to server ready. That's genuinely fast compared to providers where you're waiting 10-15 minutes or longer for provisioning.

**Payment Flexibility And Billing**

EvoXT accepts credit cards, debit cards, PayPal, and multiple cryptocurrencies. You can prepay for longer periods (monthly up to three years) or add credits to your account that automatically apply to invoices.

Their pricing model is straightforward—if you order a $5.99 plan, you pay $5.99. They don't charge surprise bandwidth overage fees or CPU burst penalties that suddenly appear on your invoice. The transparency helps with budgeting, especially for businesses needing predictable costs.

**Who Should Consider EvoXT**

This provider makes sense for several specific use cases. Developers running CPU-intensive applications benefit from those high-frequency cores—compiling code, running build processes, or testing performance-sensitive applications all favor faster single-threaded speeds over just piling on cores.

Small to medium businesses needing reliable hosting at predictable costs fit EvoXT's model. The entry plans handle typical WordPress sites, small databases, or business applications without requiring enterprise-tier pricing.

Projects targeting Asian markets should definitely look at EvoXT's infrastructure there. The combination of local data centers, regional ISP peering, and optimized routing provides better performance than hosting in North America or Europe and serving Asian users.

Testing and development environments work great on the lower-tier plans. At $2.99 for the smallest VM, you can spin up development servers, staging environments, or testing platforms without major budget impact.

**Who Might Want Alternatives**

If you need extremely high memory or storage configurations beyond what EvoXT's standard plans offer, you might need to look at their dedicated servers or other providers. Their largest standard VM hits 32 GB RAM and 100 GB storage, which works for many use cases but not specialized database servers or storage-heavy applications.

Mission-critical enterprise applications requiring formal SLAs, guaranteed response times, and premium support tiers would likely want enterprise-focused providers. EvoXT operates more in the SMB and developer segments rather than enterprise infrastructure.

Compliance requirements for specific certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, etc.) would need verification with EvoXT's actual certifications. Some regulated industries require hosting with providers holding specific compliance standards.

**Making The Decision**

Here's my honest take after looking through all the information. EvoXT occupies this interesting niche where they're delivering legitimate performance specs—those AMD EPYC Genoa processors aren't marketing fluff—at pricing that undercuts many competitors.

The 40% recurring discount changes the value equation significantly. A $5.99 VM-1 plan drops to $3.59 per month with the discount, which gets you 2GB RAM, 20GB NVMe storage, 1TB bandwidth, weekly backups, and that 6.0 GHz CPU frequency. That's genuinely competitive, especially compared to the big cloud providers where comparable specs cost considerably more.

The global infrastructure spread gives you options for placing servers close to users, which matters more for performance than raw specs in many cases. A server in the same region as your users will feel faster than a technically superior server on another continent.

The management features—VNC access, firewall controls, easy cloning, API support—make daily operations smoother. These aren't revolutionary features, but they're implemented in ways that actually work instead of feeling like afterthoughts.

Should you immediately migrate your entire infrastructure to EvoXT? Probably not without testing. But should you spin up a test instance on one of their lower-tier plans and see how it performs for your specific use case? That seems reasonable.

At these price points, the risk of testing is minimal. Grab one of those promo codes, deploy a VM in a region close to your users, and run your actual applications on it. Performance benchmarks from other users are useful, but nothing beats testing with your specific workload.

**Getting Started**

If you're interested in trying EvoXT, here's the practical path forward. 

👉 [Visit EvoXT and explore their plans](https://console.evoxt.com/aff.php?aff=1168)

Start with a smaller plan matching your immediate needs. You can always scale up through their upgrade system later. Look for current promo codes (the 40% recurring discount is particularly valuable) during checkout. Choose a data center location close to your primary user base or your own location for management purposes.

Most popular operating systems deploy with one-click installation—Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, and Windows Server all work. The control panel guides you through initial setup, and your server typically provisions within a few minutes.

Remember that weekly backups are automatic, but you might want to supplement with more frequent backups for critical data. Set up your firewall rules through the control panel before deploying applications. Test performance with your actual workload rather than just looking at synthetic benchmarks.

The company accepts prepayment for multiple months if you want to lock in pricing and ensure continuity. Account credits get applied automatically to new invoices, which simplifies billing.

EvoXT isn't trying to revolutionize hosting—they're just delivering solid VPS performance at prices that make sense for smaller projects and businesses. Sometimes that's exactly what you need, without the complexity and cost of enterprise-tier providers. Whether it fits your specific needs depends on your requirements, but the combination of specs, pricing, and global coverage makes it worth evaluating.
